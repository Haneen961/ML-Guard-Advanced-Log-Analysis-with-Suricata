# ML-Guard-Advanced-Log-Analysis-with-Suricata

ML-Guard: Advanced Log Analysis with Suricata is a comprehensive security analysis framework designed to detect and monitor cyber threats using AI-driven detection models and Suricata-based intrusion analysis.

üìå Project Structure
Our project consists of several key components:

AI Algorithms & Models

Machine learning models trained for detecting SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Layer 7 DDoS attacks.
Supports various attack detection mechanisms with high accuracy.
Can be adapted to detect different variations of these attacks by modifying datasets and feature selection.
Suricata Rules & Configuration

Custom Suricata rules for detecting SQLi, XSS, and Layer 7 DDoS threats.
Configurable to enhance detection precision.
Backend Python Scripts

Handles log monitoring, feature extraction, and preprocessing.
Connects with AI models for real-time threat evaluation.
Communicates with the front-end app & web dashboard for live analysis and visualization.
üöÄ Adapting the Project for Different Attack Variants
If you want to extend or refine the detection of SQLi, XSS, or Layer 7 DDoS attacks, you can:
‚úÖ Use our AI algorithms but modify the dataset and feature engineering process.
‚úÖ Train models with new patterns of SQLi, XSS, or DDoS attacks.

‚ö° Using Pre-Trained Models
If you want to use our pre-trained models:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the trained models from the repository.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Use the backend scripts to monitor logs and pass them to the AI models.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The AI models will evaluate the logs and identify potential SQLi, XSS, or Layer 7 DDoS threats.

This approach ensures easy integration and adaptability for different cybersecurity scenarios.
